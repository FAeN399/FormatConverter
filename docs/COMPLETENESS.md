# Completeness Checklist

- [x] **Structured README** following the Castle blueprint (includes Introduction, Features, Usage, Development, etc.)
- [x] **Repository structure** with clear directories (`src/`, `tests/`, `specs/`, `docs/`, `examples/`) and explanations.
- [x] **Format engines**: Separate module implemented for each format (Markdown, HTML, AML, JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV).
- [x] **Extensibility**: Adding a new format only requires adding a new engine module and updating the UI registration.
- [x] **Example conversion**: Provided example conversion (JSON to YAML) in README and example files in `examples/` directory.
- [x] **Utility logic**: Conversion orchestration is handled in `src/web/app.js`, independent of specific format implementations.
- [x] **Testing**: Unit tests for specific cases and property-based round-trip tests are included under `tests/`.
- [x] **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) set up to run linters and tests on each push/PR.
- [x] **Docker Support**: Dockerfile provided to run the app in a container and as a development environment.
- [x] **Specification**: Detailed project spec and design notes included in `specs/FormatConverterSpec.md`.
